* glib-2.0 >= 2.32
* fuse >= 2.8.4
* libxml-2.0 >= 2.6
* libcrypto >= 0.9
* libssl >= 0.9
* libevent >= 2.1.2 (development version)

All libraries and versions (except libevent 2.1.2) are compatible with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

This is a command line to install all requirements to build this project on Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc make automake autoconf libtool pkg-config intltool libglib2.0-dev libfuse-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev

To install libevent 2.1.2 development version:
* download latest 2.1.x sources from http://libevent.org/
* extract archive
* configure to install it into /opt/libevent2.1 folder:
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/libevent2.1/ --enable-openssl
* make && make install


How to build HydraFS
------------------

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/libevent2.1/lib/pkgconfig ./configure
make
#make install


Provide configure script with --enable-debug-mode flag if you want to get a debug build.

How to start using HydraFS
------------------------

export HydraFS_USER="Swift username"
export HydraFS_PWD="Swift password"

./hydrafs.sh [http://auth.api.yourcloud.com/v1.0] [container] [options] [mountpoint]


Where options could be:

-v: Verbose output
-f: Do not daemonize process
-c path:  Path to configuration file

Configuration file
------------------
    
Configuration file (hydrafs.conf) is located in $(prefix)/etc directory.

Bug reporting
-------------
    
Please include version of hydrafs and libraries by running:

hydrafs --version


Certificates
-------------

In order to use HTTPS you need to prepare a PEM certificate, which contains all trusted CA certificates.
For example, if you have 2 different .pem certificates (or .crt), perform the following action:

cat 1.pem >> out.pem
cat 2.pem >> out.pem

and set path to out.pem in "conenction.ssl_ca_cert" section of configuration file.
